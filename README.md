# Covfefe-Attack
Like Space Invaders, made with Python

INSTRUCTIONS: Open alien_invasion.py, compile, build and execute the file. The other files are modules, and an image folder. Merry Xmas.

I got the image of the spider and the face from creative commons. Attributes in code. I made the ship. I edited the pictures using Gimp. 

This game would be much better with sound! I will try to get sounds, explosions, and some other magic into it later. Any suggestions welcome!
