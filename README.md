# Covfefe-Attack
Like Space Invaders, made with Python

DOWNLOAD:  : Download all files and save them to a folder on your junk, then open the files with Python. I used Geany, a lightweight old IDE to open this. https://www.geany.org if needed.

INSTRUCTIONS to PLAY: 
Open alien_invasion.py, compile, build and execute the file. Gameplay requires a mouse or touchscreen and a keyboard. 
_______________________________________________________________

The other files are modules, and an image folder. 
make this. 
The images of the spider and the face come from creative commons. Use the ship. I edited the pictures using Gimp. 

This game would be much better with sound! I will try to get sounds, explosions, and some other magic into it later. Any suggestions welcome!

Will adapt game play with an Arduino in a printed handheld device.
