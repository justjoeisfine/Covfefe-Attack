# Covfefe-Attack
Like Space Invaders, made with Python using Pygame and Geany.

DOWNLOAD:  : Download the zip file Covfefe Attack! and save contents to a folder on your system, then open the files with Python. I used Geany, a lightweight old IDE to open this. https://www.geany.org if needed.

INSTRUCTIONS to PLAY: 
Open alien_invasion.py, compile, build and execute the file. Gameplay requires a mouse or touchscreen and a keyboard. Left Arrow, Right Arrow, Space bar to fire.
