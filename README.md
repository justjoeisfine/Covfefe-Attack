# Covfefe-Attack
Like Space Invaders, made with Python

DOWNLOAD:  : Download the zip file Covfefe Attack! and save contents to a folder on your system, then open the files with Python. I used Geany, a lightweight old IDE to open this. https://www.geany.org if needed.

INSTRUCTIONS to PLAY: 
Open alien_invasion.py, compile, build and execute the file. Gameplay requires a mouse or touchscreen and a keyboard. 
_______________________________________________________________

The other files are modules, and media. If needed, there are a couple of extra sound files. You will find the sounds used 'game_functions.py'. 
make this. 
The images of the spider and the face come from creative commons. Use the ship. I edited the pictures using Gimp. 

Will adapt game play with an Arduino in a printed handheld device.
